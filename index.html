            <h2>Curing Epilepsy Using Acoustic Holograms</h2>
            <p>A new dimension in Neurotherapy.</p>
            <h4>Do you know anyone with a disease that can’t be               cured?</h4>
          <br>
            <p>Have you ever felt like you have no power or                     control over something that you didn’t deserve to                 happen to you? Can you imagine feeling guilty and                 blaming yourself for being sick, even though it’s                 not your fault?</p>
            <p>Several people with incurable diseases including                 different types of cancer, dementia, advanced lung,               heart and liver disease, stroke, and neurological                  diseases including epilepsy go through this                       constantly. Epilepsy alone affects around 50                       million people worldwide, further contributing to                 the world's high rates of social isolation,                     unemployment and psychological issues.</p>
            <p>You must be thinking… there must be some type of treatment for epilepsy… right?</p>
          <br>
          <h4>Challenges of Antiepileptic Drugs</h4>
          <p>Antiepileptic drugs have limited efficacy, availability, and reliability.</p>
          <p>Antiepileptic drugs can only alleviate symptoms of seizures and are unable to cure epilepsy.</p>
          <p>Long-term use of these drugs is constrained by their negative effects, withdrawal symptoms, harmful interactions with other drugs, and economic burden, particularly in developing nations.</p>
          <p>Around 80% of people reside in developing countries — 80% to 90% of which have difficulties in accessing treatment.</p>

            <h2>About Us: Neurative</h2>
            <p>Neurative is dedicated to revolutionizing epilepsy treatment using 3D-printed acoustic holograms.</p>
          <p>At Neurative, we use 3D printing technology and acoustic holograms to potentially prevent seizures from occurring.</p>
          <p>The 3D-printed acoustic hologram technology for treating nervous system diseases uses sound waves to create a 3D image of a patient’s brain. Special equipment like ultrasound transducers and computational algorithms are used to generate and direct these sound waves towards the targeted part of the brain which triggers seizures.</p>
          <p>Scientists are currently testing 3D-printed acoustic holograms to treat Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases. However, this technology can also be customized for epilepsy. Researchers are using this technology to analyze the unique neural patterns of patients with epilepsy to identify and predict seizures. They can create personalized holograms that imitate these patterns, which can stimulate the affected areas of the brain using sound waves, potentially preventing seizures from occurring in the first place.</p>
